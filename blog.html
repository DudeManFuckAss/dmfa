Do to popular ( two people ) request the blog is back.
Okay but actually collection 1 shirts are being made. If you are waiting for an order the will be shipped or handed to you by next monday 100%. <br>
I will have goodies in some of the orders. I'm v happy with how everything turned out this set of screens and am ready to get onto a different set already. <br>
im trying to get some stickers made and will be handmaking patches for our more dedicated stans. (fuckasses??????????????? Media Junkies?????????) <br>
I honestly dont know what to make of this D.M.F.A. thing yet if im being honest. Like yeah printing on shirts is fun and tight. plus "self expression" so <br>
thats cool. also after all this technical robat unhuman ass writing ive been doing screeching onto a keyboard is theraputric and makes my balls quake <br>
why the fuck do people want this back. idk but i will comply <br>
